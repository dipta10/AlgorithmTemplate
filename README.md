### How to run the .md files:

I've used Markdown with **[MathJAX](https://www.mathjax.org/)** in all these md files.

To render it on browser you'll have to download and install this [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mathjax-plugin-for-github/ioemnmodlmafdkllaclgeombjnmnbima/related?hl=en) Extension and it should look like the following. (It might be a little bit buggy, and it's not guaranteed to work always.)

The simplest way of running these .md offline files is to use **VS Code** and install some plugins.

1.  Install VsCode.
2.  Install [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) plugin.
3.  Open the md file in VS Editor.
4.  Press `Ctrl-Shift-p` (`CMD-Shift-p` in Mac), and write `MarkDown: Open Preview` and you're done! <br>![](/imgMD/img3.png)
